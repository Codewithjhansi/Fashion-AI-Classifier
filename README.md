# 👗 Fashion MNIST Classifier

🧠 Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify fashion items like shirts, trousers, and shoes using the Fashion MNIST dataset. This project was developed during my final-year major project using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Train a CNN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset with 10 fashion categories.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics and visualize predictions.
- Develop a project suitable for real-world deployment in fashion classification tools.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Fashion MNIST Dataset
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 💡 Key Features

- Deep learning model trained on 70,000 labeled fashion images.
- Classifies grayscale clothing images with high accuracy.
- Visualizes predictions and performance metrics clearly.
- Modular and easy to extend for real-time applications.
